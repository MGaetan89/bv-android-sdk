# Changelog

# 4.2.0

## **NEW** Location

This release provides a new module for adding location awareness to your app. This module facilitates 
knowing when your shoppers are entering and exiting your physical retail locations. You will be 
provided a very valuable opportunity to present a shopper with your location aware content. Perhaps 
you have a simple greeting or coupon? Aside from the value you add within your mobile experience, 
Bazaarvoice can use this location context to enhance our existing products. Rating and Reviews 
filtered down to the city level, recommended products for nearby people like you, local social media 
content (Curations), and more are all possible by using the Location module.

For more information, please refer to the location documenation 
 https://bazaarvoice.github.io/bv-android-sdk/location.html

### Conversations Revamped 

This release provides a vast improvement over the current display and submission API for Conversations. 
The following improvements will:

* decrease implementation time
* provide deserialized responses returned in P.O.J.O (plain old java objects), as opposed to returning 
a raw json response string
* make error handling much simpler, (e.g. wrapping legacy conversations API implementation details so 
you don't have to worry about it
* provide View container objects, which makes ROI reporting much simpler

We have deprecated the ```BazaarRequest``` class as well as any related classes to implement 
Conversation the old way. For any clients migrating from the ```BazaarRequest``` API, please refer to 
the upgrade guide: https://bazaarvoice.github.io/bv-android-sdk/upgrading_conversations.html
