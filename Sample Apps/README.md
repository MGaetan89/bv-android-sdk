Reference Apps
===

These apps are meant to show you some of what can be done with the Bazaarvoice SDK and the best-implementation practices for doing these things. All of the code relevant to the SDK has been put in a file called _BazaarFunctions.java_ so you can find what you are looking for more easily.

Note: Using a static class to wrap these SDK calls is not a preferred practice. This is just here to make it easy to use these examples as a reference.

**Important**: If you are a Bazaarvoice client or if you are a developer representing a Bazaarvoice client, 
review submission takes at least 15 minutes to get through moderation. 
If you want to make sure your reviews are being submitted correctly, wait a bit and check https://workbench.bazaarvoice.com. 
A response with no errors does not necessarily mean that any media has been attached correctly.

Running the Apps
-
Once you have downloaded the directory of the app you want to run, follow these steps.

1. Open Android Studio and select 'Import Existing Project'
2. Locate the downloaded project
3. Run the application by choosing one of the Activity files in the Package Explorer and clicking the run button.
	*	For the Intent Example, take a photo with the stock browser on a phone and share with BV Photo Share after "running" the app which installs it on the phone.

Note: The Review Submission example depends on the PhotoPicker+ project.  Both must be imported in order for the example to run.  See the Review Submission README.md for details.
