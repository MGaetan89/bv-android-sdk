ReviewSubmissionExample
====================

This app simulates the flow of submitting a review for a product. The first screen is a product information page giving you the option to rate the product. Then you can take a picture for your review, and input your title, nickname, and review text. The submission uses client-side validation before and server-side validation after submitting to make sure that no fields are insufficient. If the submission is completed, your review is shown.
