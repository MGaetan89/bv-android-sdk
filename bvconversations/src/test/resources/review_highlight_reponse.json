But I love going for a ride. I have no idea what people are talking about with the radio controls being difficult. I just say AM 950, or FM whatever and it goes there. I need no dial. But if I did, is in the display and even tells me about the station. Phone hooked up in a second. I was driving a nice Q50 Infinity and decided to move up in Luxury and size with the XJL. This Jag does not fell like it is accelerating, but my own tests found it impressive. Some little glitches with the technology on first use of navigation system. Froze up everything. After the car sat a few hours all was OK and it never happened again. I heard you should lock the car, walk away, come back and unlock and would reset. Never got the chance to try that. The car itself is fantastic looking, and everyone looks and asks \"what is that?\" One guy asked if it was a Tesla. Inside is as impressive or more so. More than the other Jag models for sure. I keep it in sports mode, why not? Love the leather design and wood trim, etc. Quiet as well.",

Component speakers on the front and rear doors - work great, lots of base and crisp mid and tweeters. Sometimes at relatively high volumes you will hear some small rattles in the door. Have only had the car for a couple of months now. No issues. Did test drive a Maserati Quatrroporte - Jag luxury was better. Made was more geared for sports enthusiasts- but even while cursing the exhaust does not shut up!! So a 2 hour drive somewhere with the constant noise - was the deal breaker. The Jag also looks better than the Maze, BMW7, S-Class and Audi A8. Car rides very smoothly, when pushed above 3500 rpm, the beast leaps and you hear a wonderful growl!!! It is very quite, great seats with all the functions expected of a $100k+ car. Give great highway mileage. City mileage is what you expect with a V8. Head turner, long wheel based model - so it is one of the biggest cars out there - yet very agile. Jag has done it right. Did prefer the steering feel of the hydraulic version of my XF compared to this electronic version but still very good. Only draw back, Jag still falls short on the infotainment system - wish they had gone with Apple car play instead of having to plug my mobile in to have full interactivity with the phone. It is miles better than the old system though. Use to like driving my wife's Range Rover Sport when I had my old 2013 XF, now Being in the XJ, do not like driving the Range Rover - that is the difference in ride quality. Still did not get rid of the annoying 1 second delay between typing alphabets and numbers. Loving every moment!!",

Unfortunately there are some quality issues I need to have addressed. This is not acceptable in today's automotive competitive environment in my opinion. So in conclusion I can say that I like the comfort,handling and overall performance of the Jag but the German competitors are still built better.",

For the initial price of the vehicle, the technology is limited based on their competitors offerings at a fraction of the cost. Believe it or not, the navigation system does not accept voice instructions! I have had several instances in the first month of ownership and during the first 500 miles when systems did not perform as intended: the XM radio is not reliable, the computer display goes blank and will not respond to touch commands, the auto start seat massage is hit or miss at best, wifi system through AT&T is questionable, SOS system computer failed and had to be replaced, service has been unresponsive, difficult to reach customer service via phone and when you do, they are not familiar with the new in control programs        Big disappointment! Big waste of money for what you get!",
