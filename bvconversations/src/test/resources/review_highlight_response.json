My dogs have ranged in size from a Collie to a Corgi, But, as in all things, they eventually wore out ( after many years) and I had to replace them. I was so disappointed. They are too big. I use it on my middle finger and it is still too big. I didn\u0027t throw the old one out and even placing the new one over the old one, it still slides all around and diminishes its effectiveness. I understand that dogs mouths and their owners fingers differ in size, so hopefully you will consider manufacturing them in a small, medium and large. Thanks for listening.",
