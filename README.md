## Full SDK Documentation

For complete documentation, please refer to the [BVSDK Wiki](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-android-sdk/wiki).

## Introduction
The Bazaarvoice software development kit (BVSDK) for Android is an Android library that provides an easy way to integrate Bazaarvoice content into native Android apps on Android API 15 or newer. The BVSDK is built with modularity in mind so you can install only the components you want to work with. The primary BVSDK modules are:

### Conversations

The BVConverstaions module lets Developers display and submit content such as Ratings & Reviews, Ask & Answer and Stories, including text and photo. 

### Advertising

>**NOTE:** Previous users of the [BVAdsSDK on github](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bv-android-ads-sdk) should update to the Advertising module in this SDK.

The Advertising module allows use of Bazaarvoice's powerful shopper segment data with Google Mobile Ads. The Advertising is architected so that you can use all aspects of the [DFP (Doubleclick For Publishers) SDK](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/dfp/android/quick-start) easily, with Bazaarvoice's shopper segment functionality built in.

### Recommendations

>**Product Recommendations is currently in BETA! If you would like to participate in the Beta Pilot Program, please contact [Mobile Development at Bazaarvoice](mailto:mobilecoreteam@bazaarvoice.com)**

The Recommendations allows developers to leverage Bazaarvoice's powerful Shopper Marketing network for targeted product recommendations.
